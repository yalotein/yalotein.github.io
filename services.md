# AI-accelerated Macromolecule Discovery

we leverage cutting-edge artificial intelligence to revolutionize the discovery and development of macromolecules. By integrating sequence text and spatial structural information with advanced AI, bioinformatics, and computational biophysics methods, we evaluate and design biomacromolecules. Our proprietary algorithmic platform covers structural prediction, molecular docking, molecular design, and antibody druggability prediction, ensuring optimized activity, druggability, and other industrial properties. We are committed to driving innovation and efficiency in macromolecular research and development.
