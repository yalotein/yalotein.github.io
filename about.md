## About Us

Welcome to Sai-Long Bio, a pioneer in AI-accelerated macromolecular discovery and design. We specialize in leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, and computational biophysics to revolutionize the way biomacromolecules are discovered, designed, and optimized. Our mission is to drive innovation and efficiency in the field of macromolecular research and development, providing groundbreaking solutions for various industrial applications.

## Our Expertise

At the heart of our operations is a robust algorithmic platform that encompasses structural prediction, molecular docking, molecular design, and antibody druggability prediction. Our independently developed high-performance computing module for antigen-antibody molecular docking enables large-scale de novo antibody design. This innovation significantly enhances speed, achieving 10 to 40 times faster results compared to traditional algorithms while maintaining high precision. Preliminary experimental tests have shown a positive antibody detection rate (in the nanomolar range or better) of approximately 20%.
